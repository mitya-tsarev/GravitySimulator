## Gravity Simulator Engine
This project is a  multi-purpose package for solving n-body problems numerically. It takes in a user-written script with a description of parameters of the simulation, such as the initial state conditions, the choice of integration scheme, the timestep of integration, and the frequency and the format of the output.
## Installation, building, and running.

## Documentation.
### Units
We use the "Astronomical Unit, Solar Mass, Year" units. The constant G equals to 4Ï€<sup>2</sup> in this units system. All the quantitative input has to be expressed in this unit system, and all the output is represented in this unit system.
### The first line of the input script must specify an integration scheme.
Currently, Simple Euler, Simple Runge-Kutta, Barnes-Hut Euler, and Barnes-Hut are available. Simple integrator evaluates the accelerations of each body each timestep using pairwise interactions, spending n<sup>2</sup> operations. Euler and Runge-Kutta are the methods of performing a step once the accelerations of the bodies are calculated. The first line must start with the keyword ```method```. Next keywords must specify the integrator. Possible lines are:<br />
```method Simple Euler```<br />
```method Simple RungeKutta```<br />
```method Barnes-Hut Euler 0.05```<br />
```method Barnes-Hut RungeKutta 0.1```<br />
If the Barnes-Hut integrator is chosen, you have to specify the tolerance parameter tau of the Barnes-Hut scheme.
### The second line must specify the timestep of integration. 
The line has to start with ```timestep``` keyword followed by a number. Expample:<br />
```timestep 0.0001```<br />
### Creating bodies
There are two possible ways of creating bodies in the simulation. The first one is ```create body``` command. It must be followed by 7 numbers specifying the mass, three coordinates, and three velocities. The second option is ```create cluster``` command, which creates a cluster of bodies with the specified distributions of masses, coordinates, and velocities. In this case, you have to specify mass distribution using the keyword ```mass``` followed by a keyword for the type of distribution. Currently, ```constant``` and ```uniform``` distributions are available. Constant distribution means the mass of all the bodies in the cluster would be the same. The keyword ```constant``` must be followed with one number, and the ```uniform``` keyword must be followed with two numbers specifying the boundaries of the distribution. Same as for the ```mass```, one has to specify the distributions of ```x```, ```y```, ```z```, ```vx```, ```vy```, and ```vz```. Example:<br />
```create cluster n 100 mass constant 0 x uniform 3 4 y constant 0 z constant 0 vx constant 0 vy uniform 3.1 3.6 vz constant 0```
